# Advent_of_Code_2024

## Warning

I am not a programmer. Programming is a hobby for me and I only have experience with basic PHP, HTML, MySQL and Javascript. Please do not judge my noodle messed up code too harshly. I tried to use ChatGPT as sparingly as possible, but since I'm a noob in Vanilla JS I had to ask for a few suggestions hence why the code might seem hectic and far from polished.

You don't know what Advent of Code is? Check out their [About page](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)!

## Languages used

Since I am a Javascript noob I decided to try and do this challenge in JS to get a better grasp of the language.

## Tools used

- Documentation (Look at what functions do)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (For quick language specific questions)
- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (To ask more specific question or ask about code readability and logic)

## Why do this ?

- Because it seems to be a fun challenge
- To improve my coding skills and help me for my personal upcoming or ongoing projects

## Who are you?

I'm not a developper. I'm a linguist.
